Note: This is highly tech debt, since I copy/pasted this code from tiptap templates. It will take a while to fix.

Some of the issues:

- Code is inconsistent structure.
- Using different icon library.
- Using different component library (They use radix directly, I use shadcn/ui)
- Code doesnt really look clean. It gives the feeling its written just for the sake of getting the template to work.
- etc.

Please refactor these components to fix the issues above after the launch.
